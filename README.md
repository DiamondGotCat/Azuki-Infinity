# Azuki-Infinity
AI system specialized in generative AI

## About Azuki-Infinity
This is a system for generative AI that I'm developing to make Azuki.ai better.
I tried out Transformer and found it difficult to use, so I'm going to make my own.

## Azuki-Infinity
Automatically learning the relationships between words is fine, but it will be less accurate.
We plan to implement a manual mode that will allow the system to learn the relationships between words more accurately.
